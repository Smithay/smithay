A smithy for rusty wayland compositors

## Goals

Smithay aims to provide building blocks to create wayland compositors in Rust. While not
being a full-blown compositor, it'll provide objects and interfaces implementing common
functionalities that pretty much any compositor will need, in a generic fashion.

It supports the [core Wayland protocols](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland), the official [protocol extensions](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols), and *some* external extensions, such as those made by and for [wlroots](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlr-protocols) and [KDE](https://invent.kde.org/libraries/plasma-wayland-protocols)
<!-- https://github.com/Smithay/smithay/pull/779#discussion_r993640470 https://github.com/Smithay/smithay/issues/778 -->

Also:

- **Documented:** Smithay strives to maintain a clear and detailed documentation of its API and its
  functionalities. Compiled documentations are available on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/smithay) for released
  versions, and [here](https://smithay.github.io/smithay) for the master branch.
- **Safety:** Smithay will target to be safe to use, because Rust.
- **Modularity:** Smithay is not a framework, and will not be constraining. If there is a
  part you don't want to use, you should not be forced to use it.
- **High-level:** You should be able to not have to worry about gory low-level stuff (but 
  Smithay won't stop you if you really want to dive into it).


## Anvil

Smithay as a compositor library has its own sample compositor: anvil.

To get informations about it and how you can run it visit [anvil README](https://github.com/Smithay/smithay/blob/master/anvil/README.md)
