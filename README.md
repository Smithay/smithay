A smithy for rusty wayland compositors

## Goals

Smithay aims to provide building blocks to create wayland compositors in Rust. While not
being a full-blown compositor, it'll provide objects and interfaces implementing common
functionalities that pretty much any compositor will need, in a generic fashion.

Also:

- **Documented:** Smithay strives to maintain a clear and detailed documentation of its API and its
  functionalities. Compiled documentations are available on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/smithay) for released
  versions, and [here](https://smithay.github.io/smithay) for the master branch.
- **Safety:** Smithay will target to be safe to use, because Rust.
- **Modularity:** Smithay is not a framework, and will not be constraining. If there is a
  part you don't want to use, you should not be forced to use it.
- **High-level:** You should be able to not have to worry about gory low-level stuff (but 
  Smithay won't stop you if you really want to dive into it).

## Anvil

Like others, Smithay as a compositor library has its own sample compositor: anvil.

You can run it with cargo after having cloned this repository:

```
cd anvil;

cargo run -- --{backend}
```

The currently available backends are:

- `--winit`: start anvil as a [Winit](https://github.com/tomaka/winit) application. This allows you to run it
  inside of an other X11 or Wayland session.
- `--tty-udev`: start anvil in a tty with udev support. This is the "traditional" launch of a Wayland
  compositor. Note that this requires you to start anvil as root if your system does not have logind
  available ([consolekit support is planned](https://github.com/Smithay/smithay/issues/95)). To use logind,
  you need to activate the associated cargo feature:

  ```
  cargo run --features logind -- --tty-udev
  ```
