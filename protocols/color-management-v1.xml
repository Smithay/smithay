  <description summary="color management protocol">
    The aim of the color management extension is to allow clients to know
    the color properties of outputs, and to tell the compositor about the color
    properties of their content on surfaces. Doing this enables a compositor
    to perform automatic color management of content for different outputs
    according to how content is intended to look like.

    The color properties are represented as an image description object which
    is immutable after it has been created. A wl_output always has an
    associated image description that clients can observe. A wl_surface
    always has an associated preferred image description as a hint chosen by
    the compositor that clients can also observe. Clients can set an image
    description on a wl_surface to denote the color characteristics of the
    surface contents.

    An image description includes SDR and HDR colorimetry and encoding, HDR
    metadata, and viewing environment parameters. An image description does
    not include the properties set through color-representation extension.
    It is expected that the color-representation extension is used in
    conjunction with the color management extension when necessary,
    particularly with the YUV family of pixel formats.

    Recommendation ITU-T H.273
    "Coding-independent code points for video signal type identification"
    shall be referred to as simply H.273 here, and it defines the CICP values.

    The color-and-hdr repository
    (https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pq/color-and-hdr) contains
    background information on the protocol design and legacy color management.
    It also contains a glossary, learning resources for digital color, tools,
    samples and more.

    The terminology used in this protocol is based on common color science and
    color encoding terminology where possible. The glossary in the color-and-hdr
    repository shall be the authority on the definition of terms in this
    protocol.

      <description summary="mastering display primaries as chromaticity coordinates">
        Provides the color primaries and white point of the mastering display
        using CIE 1931 xy chromaticity coordinates. This is compatible with the
        SMPTE ST 2086 definition of HDR static metadata.

        The primaries and transfer characteristics define how an encoded pixel
        value is converted to CIE 1931 XYZ but they do not define what
        sub-volume of the container color volume in XYZ is meaningful for the
        content. The mastering display primaries help defining this target color
        volume. Compositors may use the target color volume to improve gamut
        mapping when applicable for the chosen rendering intent.

        If mastering display primaries are not explicitly set, the target
        color volume is assumed to be equal to the primary color volume.

        The target color volume can exceed the primary color volume to allow for
        a greater color volume with an existing color space definition (for
        example scRGB). It can be smaller than the primary color volume to
        minimize gamut and tone mapping distances for big color spaces (HDR
        metadata).

        To make use of the entire target color volume a suitable pixel format
        has to be chosen (e.g. floating point to exceed the primary color
        volume, or abusing limited quantization range as with xvYCC).

        Each coordinate value is multiplied by 10000 to get the argument
        value to carry precision of 4 decimals.

        If mastering display primaries have already been set on this object,
        the protocol error already_set is raised.

        This request can be used if the compositor advertises
        wp_color_manager_v1.feature.set_mastering_display_primaries.
        Otherwise this request raises the protocol error invalid_mastering.
        The advertisement implies support only for target color
        volumes fully contained within the primary color volume.

        If a compositor additionally supports target color volume exceeding
        the primary color volume, it must advertise
        wp_color_manager_v1.feature.extended_target_volume.
        If a client uses target color volume exceeding the primary color volume
        and the compositor does not support it, the result is implementation
        defined. Compositors are recommended to detect this case and fail the
        image description gracefully, but it may as well result in color
        artifacts.
