//! This module represents abstraction on top the linux direct rendering manager api (drm).
//!
//! ## [`DrmDevice`]
//!
//! A device exposes certain properties, which are directly derived
//! from the *device* as perceived by the direct rendering manager api (drm). These resources consists
//! out of connectors, encoders, framebuffers, planes and crtcs.
//!
//! [`crtc`](drm::control::crtc)s represent scanout engines of the device pointer to one framebuffer.
//! Their responsibility is to read the data of the framebuffer and export it into an "Encoder".
//! The number of crtc's represent the number of independent output devices the hardware may handle.
//!
//! On modern graphic cards it is better to think about the `crtc` as some sort of rendering engine.
//! You can only have so many different pictures, you may display, as you have `crtc`s, but a single image
//! may be put onto multiple displays.
//!
//! An [`encoder`](drm::control::encoder) encodes the data of connected crtcs into a video signal for a fixed set of connectors.
//! E.g. you might have an analog encoder based on a DAG for VGA ports, but another one for digital ones.
//! Also not every encoder might be connected to every crtc.
//!
//! A [`connector`](drm::control::connector) represents a port on your computer, possibly with a connected monitor, TV, capture card, etc.
//!
//! A [`framebuffer`](drm::control::framebuffer) represents a buffer you may display, see `DrmSurface` below.
//!
//! A [`plane`](drm::control::plane) adds another layer on top of the crtcs, which allow us to layer multiple images on top of each other more efficiently
//! then by combining the rendered images in the rendering phase, e.g. via OpenGL. Planes have to be explicitly used by the user to be useful.
//! Every device has at least one primary plane used to display an image to the whole crtc. Additionally cursor and overlay planes may be present.
//! Cursor planes are usually very restricted in size and meant to be used for hardware cursors, while overlay planes may
//! be used for performance reasons to display any overlay on top of the image, e.g. the top-most windows.
//! Overlay planes may have a bunch of weird limitation, that you cannot query, e.g. only working on round pixel coordinates.
//! You code should never rely on a fixed set of overlay planes, but always have a fallback solution in place.
//!
//! The main functionality of a `Device` in smithay is to give access to all these properties for the user to
//! choose an appropriate rendering configuration. What that means is defined by the requirements and constraints documented
//! in the specific device implementations. The second functionality is the creation of a `Surface`.
//! Surface creation requires a `crtc` (which cannot be the same as another existing `Surface`'s crtc), a plane,
//! as well as a `Mode` and a set of `connectors`.
//!
//! smithay does not make sure that `connectors` are not already in use by another `Surface`. Overlapping `connector`-Sets may
//! be an error or result in undefined rendering behavior depending on the `Surface` implementation.
//!
//! ## [`DrmSurface`]
//!
//! A surface is a part of a `Device` that may output a picture to a number of connectors. It pumps pictures of buffers to outputs.
//!
//! On surface creation a matching encoder for your `connector` is automatically selected, if one exists(!),
//! which means you still need to check your configuration beforehand, even if you do not need to provide an encoder.
//!
//! A surface consists of one `crtc` that is rendered to by the user. This is fixed for the `Surface`s lifetime and cannot be changed.
//! A surface also always needs at least one connector to output the resulting image to as well as a `Mode` that is valid for the given connectors.
//!
//! The state of a `Surface` is double-buffered, meaning all operations that chance the set of `connector`s or their `Mode` are stored and
//! only applied on the next commit. `Surface`s do their best to validate these changes, if possible.
//!
//! A commit/page_flip may be triggered to apply the pending state.
//!
//! ## Rendering
//!
//! The drm infrastructure makes no assumptions about the used renderer and does not interface with them directly.
//! It just provides a way to create framebuffers from various buffer types (mainly `DumbBuffer`s and hardware-backed gbm `BufferObject`s).
//!
//! Buffer management and details about the various types can be found in the [`allocator`-Module](crate::backend::allocator) and
//! rendering abstractions, which can target these buffers can be found in the [`renderer`-Module](crate::backend::renderer).
//!
//! ## [`DrmNode`]
//!
//! A drm node refers to a drm device and the capabilities that may be performed using the node.
//! Generally [`DrmNode`] is primarily used by clients (such as the output backends) which need
//! to allocate buffers for use in X11 or Wayland. If you need to do mode setting, you should use
//! [`DrmDevice`] instead.
