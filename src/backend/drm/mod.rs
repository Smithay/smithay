//!
//!
//! This module provides Traits reprensentating open devices
//! and their surfaces to render contents.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! Initialization of devices happens through an open file descriptor
//! of a drm device.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! Initialization of surfaces happens through the types provided by
//! [`drm-rs`](drm).
//!
//! Four entities are relevant for the initialization procedure.
//!
//! [`crtc`](drm::control::crtc)s represent scanout engines
//! of the device pointer to one framebuffer.
//! Their responsibility is to read the data of the framebuffer and export it into an "Encoder".
//! The number of crtc's represent the number of independant output devices the hardware may handle.
//!
//! An [`encoder`](drm::control::encoder) encodes the data of
//! connected crtcs into a video signal for a fixed set of connectors.
//! E.g. you might have an analog encoder based on a DAG for VGA ports, but another one for digital ones.
//! Also not every encoder might be connected to every crtc.
//!
//! A [`connector`](drm::control::connector) represents a port
//! on your computer, possibly with a connected monitor, TV, capture card, etc.
//!
//! On surface creation a matching encoder for your `encoder`-`connector` is automatically selected,
//! if it exists, which means you still need to check your configuration.
//!
//! At last a [`Mode`](drm::control::Mode) needs to be selected,
//! supported by the `crtc` in question.
