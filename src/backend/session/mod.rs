//! Abstraction of different session APIs.
//!
//! Sessions provide a way for multiple graphical systems to run in parallel by providing
//! mechanisms to switch between and handle device access and permissions for every running
//! instance. They are crucial to allow unprivileged processes to use graphical or input
//! devices.
//!
//! The functions of the provided interfaces lies in two main components: the ability to
//! open privileged devices, and be notified about when the session is paused and resumed
//! (for example when the user switches to an other TTY, or is the computer goes to sleep).
//!
//! ## General use
//!
//! Session handling in Smithay is done through a pair of types that each session provider implements.
//!
//! The first is a handle implementing the [`Session`] trait, which allows you to request the opening
//! of devices, a VT change, or informations about the session state.
//!
//! The second is a notifier which informs you when the session is enabled or disabled by the system.
//! This notifier takes the form of a [`calloop`] event source, but it does not generates any event
//! directly. Instead, it gives you a [`Signaler`](crate::utils::signaling::Signaler) that you can
//! pass around to other backend modules that need to be notified of the new session state, to stop
//! accessing the devices while the session is disabled. Notable examples are the
//! [`libinput`](super::libinput) and [`drm`](super::drm) backends.
//!
//! ## Available providers
//!
//! This module provides session implementations based on different providers:
//!
//! - Through [libseat](https://sr.ht/~kennylevinsen/seatd/), gated by the `backend_session_libseat`
//!   cargo feature
//! - Through logind or elogind, gated by the `backend_session_logind` and `backend_session_elogind`
//!   cargo features (which are incompatible with each other)
//! - Through the direct kernel VT interface. This last option is intended as a fallback, as this is
//!   a legacy API.
//!
//! In general, you'll want to use the [`auto`] wrapper, that automatically discovers which
//! provider is available and selects the "best" one (in the order of the previous list). See the
//! module-level documentation of each provider for its precise usage.
