//!
//! Input abstractions
//!
//! This module provides some types loosely resembling instances of wayland seats, pointers and keyboards.
//! It is however not directly tied to wayland and can be used to multiplex various input operations
//! between different handlers.
//!
//! If the [`wayland_frontend`]-feature is enabled the `smithay::wayland::seat`-module provides additional
//! functionality for the provided types of this module to map them to advertised wayland globals and objects.
//!
//! ## How to use it
//!
//! To start using this module you need to create a [`SeatState`] and use that to create [`Seat`]s.
//! Additionally you need to implement the [`SeatHandler`] trait.
//!  
//! ### Initialization
//!
//! ```
//! use smithay::input::{Seat, SeatState, SeatHandler, keyboard::KeyboardHandler, pointer::CursorImageStatus};
//!
//! struct State {
//!     seat_state: SeatState<Self>,
//!     // ...
//! };
//!
//! let mut seat_state = SeatState::<State>::new();
//!
//! // create the seat
//! let seat = seat_state.new_seat(
//!     "seat-0",  // the name of the seat, will be advertized to clients
//!     None       // insert a logger here
//! );
//!
//! // implement the required traits
//! impl SeatHandler for State {
//!     fn seat_state(&mut self) -> &mut SeatState<Self> {
//!         &mut self.seat_state
//!     }
//!
//!     fn focus_changed(&mut self, seat: &Seat<Self>, focused: Option<&dyn KeyboardHandler<Self>>) {
//!         // handle focus changes, if you need to ...
//!     }
//!     fn cursor_image(&mut self, seat: &Seat<Self>, image: CursorImageStatus) {
//!         // handle new images for the cursor ...   
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Run usage
//!
//! Once the seat is initialized, you can add capabilities to it.
//!
//! Currently, pointer and keyboard capabilities are supported by this module.
//! [`smithay::wayland::seat`] also provides an abstraction to send touch-events to client,
//! further helpers are not provided at this point.
//! [`smithay::wayland::tablet_manager`] also provides client interaction for drawing tablets.
//!
//! You can add these capabilities via methods of the [`Seat`] struct:
//! [`Seat::add_keyboard`] and [`Seat::add_pointer`].
//! These methods return handles that can be cloned and sent across thread, so you can keep one around
//! in your event-handling code to forward inputs to your clients.
//!
