//!
//! Input abstractions
//!
//! This module provides some types loosely resembling instances of wayland seats, pointers, touch and keyboards.
//! It is however not directly tied to wayland and can be used to multiplex various input operations
//! between different handlers.
//!
//! If the `wayland_frontend`-feature is enabled the `smithay::wayland::seat`-module provides additional
//! functionality for the provided types of this module to map them to advertised wayland globals and objects.
//!
//! ## How to use it
//!
//! To start using this module you need to create a [`SeatState`] and use that to create [`Seat`]s.
//! Additionally you need to implement the [`SeatHandler`] trait.
//!
//! ### Initialization
//!
//! ```
//! use smithay::input::{Seat, SeatState, SeatHandler, pointer::CursorImageStatus};
//! # use smithay::backend::input::KeyState;
//! # use smithay::input::{
//! #   pointer::{PointerTarget, AxisFrame, MotionEvent, ButtonEvent, RelativeMotionEvent,
//! #             GestureSwipeBeginEvent, GestureSwipeUpdateEvent, GestureSwipeEndEvent,
//! #             GesturePinchBeginEvent, GesturePinchUpdateEvent, GesturePinchEndEvent,
//! #             GestureHoldBeginEvent, GestureHoldEndEvent},
//! #   keyboard::{KeyboardTarget, KeysymHandle, ModifiersState},
//! #   touch::{DownEvent, UpEvent, MotionEvent as TouchMotionEvent, ShapeEvent, OrientationEvent, TouchTarget},
//! # };
//! # use smithay::utils::{IsAlive, Serial};
//!
//! struct State {
//!     seat_state: SeatState<Self>,
//!     // ...
//! };
//!
//! let mut seat_state = SeatState::<State>::new();
//!
//! // create the seat
//! let seat = seat_state.new_seat(
//!     "seat-0",  // the name of the seat, will be advertized to clients
//! );
//!
//! # #[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
//! # struct Target;
//! # impl IsAlive for Target {
//! #   fn alive(&self) -> bool { true }
//! # }
//! # impl PointerTarget<State> for Target {
//! #   fn enter(&self, seat: &Seat<State>, data: &mut State, event: &MotionEvent) {}

//! #   fn axis(&self, seat: &Seat<State>, data: &mut State, frame: AxisFrame) {}
//! #   fn frame(&self, seat: &Seat<State>, data: &mut State) {}
//! #   fn leave(&self, seat: &Seat<State>, data: &mut State, serial: Serial, time: u32) {}
//! #   fn gesture_swipe_begin(&self, seat: &Seat<State>, data: &mut State, event: &GestureSwipeBeginEvent) {}
//! #   fn gesture_swipe_update(&self, seat: &Seat<State>, data: &mut State, event: &GestureSwipeUpdateEvent) {}
//! #   fn gesture_swipe_end(&self, seat: &Seat<State>, data: &mut State, event: &GestureSwipeEndEvent) {}
//! #   fn gesture_pinch_begin(&self, seat: &Seat<State>, data: &mut State, event: &GesturePinchBeginEvent) {}
//! #   fn gesture_pinch_update(&self, seat: &Seat<State>, data: &mut State, event: &GesturePinchUpdateEvent) {}
//! #   fn gesture_pinch_end(&self, seat: &Seat<State>, data: &mut State, event: &GesturePinchEndEvent) {}
//! #   fn gesture_hold_begin(&self, seat: &Seat<State>, data: &mut State, event: &GestureHoldBeginEvent) {}
//! #   fn gesture_hold_end(&self, seat: &Seat<State>, data: &mut State, event: &GestureHoldEndEvent) {}
//! # }
//! # impl KeyboardTarget<State> for Target {
//! #   fn enter(&self, seat: &Seat<State>, data: &mut State, keys: Vec<KeysymHandle<'_>>, serial: Serial) {}
//! #   fn leave(&self, seat: &Seat<State>, data: &mut State, serial: Serial) {}
//! #   fn key(
//! #       &self,
//! #       seat: &Seat<State>,
//! #       data: &mut State,
//! #       key: KeysymHandle<'_>,
//! #       state: KeyState,
//! #       serial: Serial,
//! #       time: u32,
//! #   ) {}
//! #   fn modifiers(&self, seat: &Seat<State>, data: &mut State, modifiers: ModifiersState, serial: Serial) {}
//! # }
//! # impl TouchTarget<State> for Target {
//! #   fn down(&self, seat: &Seat<State>, data: &mut State, event: &DownEvent, seq: Serial) {}
//! #   fn up(&self, seat: &Seat<State>, data: &mut State, event: &UpEvent, seq: Serial) {}
//! #   fn motion(&self, seat: &Seat<State>, data: &mut State, event: &TouchMotionEvent, seq: Serial) {}
//! #   fn frame(&self, seat: &Seat<State>, data: &mut State, seq: Serial) {}
//! #   fn cancel(&self, seat: &Seat<State>, data: &mut State, seq: Serial) {}
//! #   fn shape(&self, seat: &Seat<State>, data: &mut State, event: &ShapeEvent, seq: Serial) {}
//! #   fn orientation(&self, seat: &Seat<State>, data: &mut State, event: &OrientationEvent, seq: Serial) {}
//! # }
//!
//! // implement the required traits
//! impl SeatHandler for State {
//!     type KeyboardFocus = Target;
//!     type PointerFocus = Target;
//!     type TouchFocus = Target;
//!
//!     fn seat_state(&mut self) -> &mut SeatState<Self> {
//!         &mut self.seat_state
//!     }
//!
//!     fn focus_changed(&mut self, seat: &Seat<Self>, focused: Option<&Target>) {
//!         // handle focus changes, if you need to ...
//!     }
//!     fn cursor_image(&mut self, seat: &Seat<Self>, image: CursorImageStatus) {
//!         // handle new images for the cursor ...
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Run usage
//!
//! Once the seat is initialized, you can add capabilities to it.
//!
//! Currently, pointer, touch and keyboard capabilities are supported by this module.
//! [`tablet_manager`](crate::wayland::tablet_manager) also provides client interaction for drawing tablets.
//!
//! You can add these capabilities via methods of the [`Seat`] struct:
//! [`Seat::add_keyboard`], [`Seat::add_pointer`] and [`Seat::add_touch`].
//! These methods return handles that can be cloned and sent across thread, so you can keep one around
//! in your event-handling code to forward inputs to your clients.
//!
