/// A trait to implement a pointer grab
///
/// In some context, it is necessary to temporarily change the behavior of the pointer. This is
/// typically known as a pointer grab. A typical example would be, during a drag'n'drop operation,
/// the underlying surfaces will no longer receive classic pointer event, but rather special events.
///
/// This trait is the interface to intercept regular pointer events and change them as needed, its
/// interface mimics the [`PointerHandle`](super::PointerHandle) interface.
///
/// Any interactions with [`PointerHandle`](super::PointerHandle)
/// should be done using [`PointerInnerHandle`], as handle is borrowed/locked before grab methods are called,
/// so calling methods on [`PointerHandle`](super::PointerHandle) would result in a deadlock.
///
/// If your logic decides that the grab should end, both [`PointerInnerHandle`]
/// and [`PointerHandle`](super::PointerHandle) have
/// a method to change it.
///
/// When your grab ends (either as you requested it or if it was forcefully cancelled by the server),
/// the struct implementing this trait will be dropped. As such you should put clean-up logic in the destructor,
/// rather than trying to guess when the grab will end.
