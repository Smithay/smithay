//! Seat global utilities
//!
//! This module provides you with utilities for handling the seat globals
//! and the associated input Wayland objects.
//!
//! ## How to use it
//!
//! ### Initialization
//!
//! ```
//! # extern crate wayland_server;
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate smithay;
//! use smithay::wayland::seat::Seat;
//!
//! # fn main(){
//! # let mut event_loop = wayland_server::calloop::EventLoop::<()>::new().unwrap();
//! # let mut display = wayland_server::Display::new(event_loop.handle());
//! // insert the seat:
//! let (seat, seat_global) = Seat::new(
//!     &mut display,    // the display
//!     "seat-0".into(), // the name of the seat, will be advertized to clients
//!     None             // insert a logger here
//! );
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Run usage
//!
//! Once the seat is initialized, you can add capabilities to it.
//!
//! Currently, only pointer and keyboard capabilities are supported by
//! smithay.
//!
//! You can add these capabilities via methods of the `Seat` struct:
//!
//! ```
//! # extern crate wayland_server;
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate smithay;
//! #
//! # use smithay::wayland::seat::Seat;
//! #
//! # fn main(){
//! # let mut event_loop = wayland_server::calloop::EventLoop::<()>::new().unwrap();
//! # let mut display = wayland_server::Display::new(event_loop.handle());
//! # let (mut seat, seat_global) = Seat::new(
//! #     &mut display,
//! #     "seat-0".into(),
//! #     None
//! # );
//! let pointer_handle = seat.add_pointer();
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! These handles can be cloned and sent across thread, so you can keep one around
//! in your event-handling code to forward inputs to your clients.
