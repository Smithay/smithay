//! Protocol-related utilities
//!
//! This module contains several handlers to manage the Wayland protocol
//! and the clients.
//!
//! ## General structure
//!
//! Most utilities provided in this module work in the same way:
//!
//! - An `init` function or method will take the wayland display as argument and
//!   insert one or more globals into it.
//! - If you want to remove a previously inserted global, just call the
//!   `destroy()` method on the associated `Global`. If you don't plan to
//!   destroy the global at all, you don't need to bother keeping the
//!   `Global` around.
//!
//! Some of these modules require you to provide a callback that is invoked for some
//! client requests that your logic needs to handle. In most cases these callback
//! are given as input an enum specifying the event that occurred, as well as the
//! [`DispatchData`](wayland_server::DispatchData) from `wayland_server`.
//!
//! ## Provided helpers
//!
//! ### Core functionality
//!
//! The most fundamental module is the [`compositor`] module, which provides the necessary
//! logic to handle the fundamental component by which clients build their windows: surfaces.
//! Following this, the [`shell`] module contains the logic allowing clients to use their
//! surface to build concrete windows with the usual interactions. Different kind of shells
//! exist, but in general you will want to support at least the [`xdg`](shell::xdg) variant,
//! which is the standard used by most applications.
//!
//! Then, the [`seat`] module contains logic related to input handling. These helpers are used
//! to forward input (such as pointer action or keystrokes) to clients, and manage the input
//! focus of clients. Tightly coupled with it is the [`data_device`] module, which handles
//! cross-client interactions such as accessing the clipboard, or drag'n'drop actions.
//!
//! The [`shm`] module provides the necessary logic for client to provide buffers defining the
//! contents of their windows using shared memory. This is the main mechanism used by clients
//! that are not hardware accelerated. As a complement, the [`dmabuf`] module provides support
//! hardware-accelerated clients; it is tightly linked to the
//! [`backend::allocator`](crate::backend::allocator) module.
//!
//! The [`output`] module helps forwarding to clients information about the display monitors that
//! are available. This notably plays a key role in HiDPI handling, and more generally notifying
//! clients about whether they are currently visible or not (allowing them to stop drawing if they
//! are not, for example).
//!
//! ### Experimental helpers
//!
//! The [`explicit_synchronization`] module provides helpers to give clients fine-grained control
//! over the synchronization for accessing graphics buffer with the compositor, for low-latency
//! rendering. It is however still experimental, and largely untested.
