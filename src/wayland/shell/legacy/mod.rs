//! Utilities for handling shell surfaces with the `wl_shell` protocol
//!
//! This module provides automatic handling of shell surfaces objects, by being registered
//! as a global handler for `wl_shell`. This protocol is deprecated in favor of `xdg_shell`,
//! thus this module is provided as a compatibility layer with older clients. As a consequence,
//! you can as a compositor-writer decide to only support its functionality in a best-effort
//! maneer: as this global is part of the core protocol, you are still required to provide
//! some support for it.
//!
//! ## Why use this implementation
//!
//! This implementation can track for you the various shell surfaces defined by the
//! clients by handling the `wl_shell` protocol.
//!
//! It allows you to easily access a list of all shell surfaces defined by your clients
//! access their associated metadata and underlying `wl_surface`s.
//!
//! This handler only handles the protocol exchanges with the client to present you the
//! information in a coherent and relatively easy to use manner. All the actual drawing
//! and positioning logic of windows is out of its scope.
//!
//! ## How to use it
//!
//! ### Initialization
//!
//! To initialize this handler, simple use the [`wl_shell_init`](::wayland::shell::legacy::wl_shell_init)
//! function provided in this module. You will need to provide it the [`CompositorToken`](::wayland::compositor::CompositorToken)
//! you retrieved from an instantiation of the compositor handler provided by smithay.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # extern crate wayland_server;
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate smithay;
//! # extern crate wayland_protocols;
//! #
//! use smithay::wayland::compositor::roles::*;
//! use smithay::wayland::compositor::CompositorToken;
//! use smithay::wayland::shell::legacy::{wl_shell_init, ShellSurfaceRole, ShellRequest};
//! # use wayland_server::protocol::{wl_seat, wl_output};
//! # #[derive(Default)] struct MySurfaceData;
//!
//! // define the metadata you want associated with the shell surfaces
//! #[derive(Default)]
//! pub struct MyShellSurfaceData {
//!     /* ... */
//! }
//!
//! // define the roles type. You need to integrate the XdgSurface role:
//! define_roles!(MyRoles =>
//!     [ShellSurface, ShellSurfaceRole<MyShellSurfaceData>]
//! );
//!
//! # fn main() {
//! # let mut event_loop = wayland_server::calloop::EventLoop::<()>::new().unwrap();
//! # let mut display = wayland_server::Display::new(event_loop.handle());
//! # let (compositor_token, _, _) = smithay::wayland::compositor::compositor_init::<(), MyRoles, _, _>(
//! #     &mut display,
//! #     |_, _, _| {},
//! #     None
//! # );
//! let (shell_state, _) = wl_shell_init(
//!     &mut display,
//!     // token from the compositor implementation
//!     compositor_token,
//!     // your implementation
//!     |event: ShellRequest<_, _, MyShellSurfaceData>| { /* ... */ },
//!     None  // put a logger if you want
//! );
//!
//! // You're now ready to go!
//! # }
//! ```
