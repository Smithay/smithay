//! Utilities for handling shell surfaces with the `xdg_shell` protocol
//!
//! This module provides automatic handling of shell surfaces objects, by being registered
//! as a global handler for `xdg_shell`.
//!
//! ## Why use this implementation
//!
//! This implementation can track for you the various shell surfaces defined by the
//! clients by handling the `xdg_shell` protocol.
//!
//! It allows you to easily access a list of all shell surfaces defined by your clients
//! access their associated metadata and underlying `wl_surface`s.
//!
//! This handler only handles the protocol exchanges with the client to present you the
//! information in a coherent and relatively easy to use manner. All the actual drawing
//! and positioning logic of windows is out of its scope.
//!
//! ## How to use it
//!
//! ### Initialization
//!
//! To initialize this handler, create [`XdgShellState`], store it in your `State` struct and
//! implement the [`XdgShellHandler`], as shown in this example:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # extern crate wayland_server;
//! #
//! use smithay::delegate_xdg_shell;
//! use smithay::reexports::wayland_server::protocol::{wl_seat, wl_surface};
//! use smithay::wayland::shell::xdg::{XdgShellState, XdgShellHandler, ToplevelSurface, PopupSurface, PositionerState};
//! use smithay::utils::Serial;
//!
//! # struct State { xdg_shell_state: XdgShellState, seat_state: SeatState<Self> }
//! # let mut display = wayland_server::Display::<State>::new().unwrap();
//! let xdg_shell_state = XdgShellState::new::<State>(
//!     &display.handle(),
//! );
//!
//! // insert the xdg_shell_state into your state
//! // ...
//!
//! // implement the necessary traits
//! impl XdgShellHandler for State {
//!     fn xdg_shell_state(&mut self) -> &mut XdgShellState {
//!         &mut self.xdg_shell_state
//!     }
//!
//!     // handle the shell requests here.
//!     // more optional methods can be used to further customized
//!     fn new_toplevel(&mut self, surface: ToplevelSurface) {
//!         // ...
//!     }
//!     fn new_popup(
//!         &mut self,
//!         surface: PopupSurface,
//!         positioner: PositionerState,
//!     ) {
//!         // ...
//!     }
//!     fn grab(
//!         &mut self,
//!         surface: PopupSurface,
//!         seat: wl_seat::WlSeat,
//!         serial: Serial,
//!     ) {
//!         // ...
//!     }
//!     fn reposition_request(
//!         &mut self,
//!         surface: PopupSurface,
//!         positioner: PositionerState,
//!         token: u32,
//!     ) {
//!         // ...
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! use smithay::input::{Seat, SeatState, SeatHandler, pointer::CursorImageStatus};
//!
//! type Target = wl_surface::WlSurface;
//! impl SeatHandler for State {
//!     type KeyboardFocus = Target;
//!     type PointerFocus = Target;
//!
//!     fn seat_state(&mut self) -> &mut SeatState<Self> {
//!         &mut self.seat_state
//!     }
//!
//!     fn focus_changed(&mut self, seat: &Seat<Self>, focused: Option<&Target>) {
//!         // handle focus changes, if you need to ...
//!     }
//!     fn cursor_image(&mut self, seat: &Seat<Self>, image: CursorImageStatus) {
//!         // handle new images for the cursor ...
//!     }
//! }
//! delegate_xdg_shell!(State);
//!
//! // You're now ready to go!
//! ```
//!
//! ### Access to shell surface and clients data
//!
//! There are mainly 3 kind of objects that you'll manipulate from this implementation:
//!
//! - [`ShellClient`]:
//!   This is a handle representing an instantiation of a shell global
//!   you can associate client-wise metadata to it through an [`UserDataMap`].
//! - [`ToplevelSurface`]:
//!   This is a handle representing a toplevel surface, you can
//!   retrieve a list of all currently alive toplevel surface from the
//!   [`XdgShellState`].
//! - [`PopupSurface`]:
//!   This is a handle representing a popup/tooltip surface. Similarly,
//!   you can get a list of all currently alive popup surface from the
//!   [`XdgShellState`].
//!
//! You'll obtain these objects though two means: either via the callback methods of
//! the [`XdgShellHandler`], or via methods on the [`XdgShellState`].
