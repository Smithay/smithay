//! Buffer management utilities.
//!
//! This module provides the [`Buffer`] type to represent a [`WlBuffer`] managed by Smithay and data
//! associated with said buffer. This module has a dual purpose. This module provides a way for the compositor
//! to be told when a client has destroyed a buffer. The other purpose is to provide a way for specific types
//! of [`WlBuffer`] to abstractly associate some data with the protocol object without conflicting
//! [`Dispatch`](crate::reexports::wayland_server::Dispatch) implementations.
