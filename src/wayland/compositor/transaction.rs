// The transaction model for handling surface states in Smithay
//
// The caching logic in `cache.rs` provides surfaces with a queue of
// pending states identified with numeric commit ids, allowing the compositor
// to precisely control *when* a state become active. This file is the second
// half: these identified states are grouped into transactions, which allow the
// synchronization of updates accross surfaces.
//
// There are 2 main cases when the state of multiple surfaces must be updated
// atomically:
// - synchronized subsurface must have their state updated at the same time as their parents
// - The upcoming `wp_transaction` protocol
//
// In these situations, the individual states in a surface queue are grouped into a transaction
// and are all applied atomically when the transaction itself is applied. The logic for creating
// new transactions is currently the following:
//
// - Each surface has an implicit "pending" transaction, into which its newly commited state is
//   recorded
// - Furthermore, on commit, the pending transaction of all synchronized child subsurfaces is merged
//   into the current surface's pending transaction, and a new implicit transaction is started for those
//   children (logic is implemented in `handlers.rs`, in `PrivateSurfaceData::commit`).
// - Then, still on commit, if the surface is not a synchronized subsurface, its pending transaction is
//   directly applied
//
// This last step will change once we have support for explicit synchronization (and further in the future,
// of the wp_transaction protocol). Explicit synchronization introduces a notion of blockers: the transaction
// cannot be applied before all blockers are released, and thus must wait for it to be the case.
//
// For thoses situations, the (currently unused) `TransactionQueue` will come into play. It is a per-client
// queue of transactions, that stores and applies them by both respecting their topological order
// (ensuring that for each surface, states are applied in the correct order) and that all transactions
// wait befor all their blockers are resolved to be merged. If a blocker is cancelled, the whole transaction
// it blocks is cancelled as well, and simply dropped. Thanks to the logic of `Cache::apply_state`, the
// associated state will be applied automatically when the next valid transaction is applied, ensuring
// global coherence.

// A significant part of the logic of this module is not yet used,
// but will be once proper transaction & blockers support is
// added to smithay
