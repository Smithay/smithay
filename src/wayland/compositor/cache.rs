// The caching logic is used to process surface synchronization. It creates
// an effective decoupling between the moment the client sends wl_surface.commit
// and the moment where the state that was commited is actually applied by the
// compositor.
//
// The way this is modelled in Smithay is through the `Cache` type, which is a container
// representing a cached state for a particular type. The full cached state of a surface
// is thus composed of a a set of `Cache<T>` for all relevant `T`, as modelled by the
// `MultiCache`.
//
// The logic of the `Cache` is as follows:
//
// - The protocol handlers mutably access the `pending` state to modify it accord to
//   the client requests
// - On commit, a snapshot of this pending state is created by invoking `Cacheable::commit`
//   and stored in the cache alongside an externally provided id
// - When the compositor decices that a given state (represented by its commit id) should
//   become active, `Cache::apply_state` is invoked with that commit id. The associated state
//   is then applied to the `current` state, that the compositor can then use as a reference
//   for the current window state. Note that, to preserve the commit ordering, all states
//   with a commit id older than the one requested are applied as well, in order.
//
// The logic for generating these commit ids and deciding when to apply them is implemented
// and described in `transaction.rs`.

///
/// The type needs to implement the [`Default`] trait, which will be used
/// to initialize. You further need to provide two methods:
/// [`Cacheable::commit`] and [`Cacheable::merge_into`].
///
/// Double-buffered state works by having a "pending" instance of your type,
/// into which new values provided by the client are inserted. When the client
/// sends `wl_surface.commit`, the [`Cacheable::commit`] method will be
/// invoked on your value. This method is expected to produce a new instance of
/// your type, that will be stored in the cache, and eventually merged into the
/// current state.
///
/// In most cases, this method will simply produce a copy of the pending state,
/// but you might need additional logic in some cases, such as for handling
/// non-cloneable resources (which thus need to be moved into the produce value).
///
/// Then at some point the [`Cacheable::merge_into`] method of your type will be
/// invoked. In this method, `self` acts as the update that should be merged into
/// the current state provided as argument. In simple cases, the action would just
/// be to copy `self` into the current state, but more complex cases require
/// additional logic.
