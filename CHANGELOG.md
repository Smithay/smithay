# Smithay Changelog

## Unreleased

### Breaking Changes

#### Clients & Protocols

- Remove `xdg-shell-unstable-v6` backwards compatibility
- `XdgPositionerState` moved to `XdgPopupState` and added to `XdgRequest::NewPopup`
- `PopupSurface::send_configure` now checks the protocol version and returns an `Result`
- `KeyboardHandle::input` filter closure now receives a `KeysymHandle` instead of a `Keysym` and returns a `FilterResult`.

#### Backend

- Added `TabletToolType::Unknown` as an option for tablet events

### Additions

#### Clients & Protocols

- `xdg_activation_v1` support
- `wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1` support
- Added public api constants for the roles of `wl_shell_surface`, `zxdg_toplevel` and `xdg_toplevel`. See the
  `shell::legacy` and `shell::xdg` modules for these constants.
- Whether a surface is toplevel equivalent can be determined with the new function `shell::is_toplevel_equivalent`.
- Setting the parent of a toplevel surface is now possible with the `xdg::ToplevelSurface::set_parent` function.
- Add support for the zxdg-foreign-v2 protocol.
- Support for `xdg_wm_base` protocol version 3
- Added the option to initialize the dmabuf global with a client filter

#### Backends

- New `x11` backend to run the compositor as an X11 client. Enabled through the `backend_x11` feature.
- `x11rb` event source integration used in anvil's XWayland implementation is now part of smithay at `utils::x11rb`. Enabled through the `x11rb_event_source` feature. 
- `KeyState`, `MouseButton`, `ButtonState` and `Axis` in `backend::input` now derive `Hash`.
- New `DrmNode` type in drm backend. This is primarily for use a backend which needs to run as client inside another session.

### Bugfixes

#### Clients & Protocols

- `Multicache::has()` now correctly does what is expected of it

#### Backends

- EGLBufferReader now checks if buffers are alive before using them.
- LibSeat no longer panics on seat disable event.

### Anvil

- Anvil now implements the x11 backend in smithay. Run by passing `--x11` into the arguments when launching.
- Passing `ANVIL_MUTEX_LOG` in environment variables now uses the slower `Mutex` logging drain.

## version 0.3.0 (2021-07-25)

Large parts of Smithay were changed with numerous API changes. It is thus recommended to
approach version 0.3 as if it was a new crate altogether compared to 0.2.

The most notable changes are:

- Deep refactor of the graphics backends around a workflows centered on allocating graphics buffers,
  and a Gles2-based renderer abstraction is provided.
- Support for DRM atomic modesetting as well as client-provided DMABUF
- Most backends are now `calloop` event sources generating events. The recommended organization for
  your smithay-based compositor is thus to centralize most of your logic on a global state struct,
  and delegate event handling to it via the shared data mechanism of `calloop`. Most of the callbacks
  you provide to Smithay are given mutable access to this shared data.
- The `wayland::compositor` handling logic now automatically handles state tracking and delayed commit
  for wayland surfaces.

Many thanks to the new contributors to Smithay, who contributed the following:

- Support for [`libseat`](https://sr.ht/~kennylevinsen/seatd/) as a session backend, by
  @PolyMeilex
- Support for graphics tablets via the `tablet` protocol extension, by @PolyMeilex
- Support for running Smithay on `aarch64` architectures, by @cmeissl
- A rework of the `xdg-shell` handlers to better fit the protocol logic and correctly track configure
  events, by @cmeissl
- Basic Xwayland support, by @psychon
